\f0\fs24 \cf0 #The colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation\
\
##Introduction\
\
Is there a causal relationship between the quality of institutions and a country\'92s GDP or is the renowned correlation between the two due to the simple fact that only rich countries seem to be able to afford good institutional structures?\
\
Three premises:\
\
1. Different types of colonization policies yielded different types of institutions: on the one hand \'93extractive colonies\'94 were exclusively exploited for their precious resources and their occupation did not resulted in extended development of institutions and protection of property rights, on the other hand \'93Neo-Europes\'94 were regions, which Europeans colonized with a long-term perspective of settlement, i.e. replicating European institutions, safeguarding the private property and imposing strong checks on government power;\
\
2. More favorable environments brought to settlement, while regions where settlement was less feasible were only exploited;\
\
3. Even after gaining independence, colonial states survived with their institutions.\
\
Hence, Acemoglu et al. refers to the mortality rates expected by the first colonists as the instrument emplyoed in the process of confirming the causal relationship between the quality of a countries institution and its economic performance (in terms of gdp).\
